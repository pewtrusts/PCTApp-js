This repo provides the basic extendable class for prerenderable and hydratable components used in a few PCT interactive from 2018 into 2019, before switching to Svelte for most. It normalized and made repeatable the process for creating views and components that would render and hydrate during local development, prerender during build the build process, patch the HTML if live data did not match with the data from the build step, and then rehydrate the scripts. Kinda cool but no longer in use.
